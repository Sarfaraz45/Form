<h1> Artificial Intelligence</h1>
A ONE YEAR AI PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS.
GETTING PAKISTAN READY FOR THE NEW ERA OF COMPUTING ENABLED BY THE RISE OF AI.
</p>

<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
<p id = "cnc"> 
<h1> Cloud Native Computing </h1>
Cloud native computing uses open-source software stacks to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each part into 
its own container and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilization. In the last 15 years, 
cloud application delivery has moved from being bound to physical servers to running on virtual machines

<p id = "bcc"> <h1>Block Chain Computing  </h1>
In this module, students will get an introduction to digital money, bitcoin and the blockchain. 
Students will learn about trestles systems and proof of work. Students will also learn the difference between private, 
consortium, and public blockchain networks. 
This module will also provide an introduction to hashing and cryptography.

</p>
<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

<p id = "iot"> 
<h1> Internet Of Things</h1>
IoT devices are implemented using both hardware and software components. Dedicated hardware components are used to implement the
 interface with the physical world, and to perform tasks which are more computationally complex. Microcontrollers are used to 
 execute software that interprets inputs and controls the system.
 This module discusses the roles of both the hardware and software components in the system.
